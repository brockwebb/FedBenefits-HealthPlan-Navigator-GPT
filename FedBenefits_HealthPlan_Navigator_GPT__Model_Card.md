## **Model Overview**

**Model Name**: FedBenefits Health Plan Navigator GPT  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Model Type**: Generative AI Decision Support Tool  
**Developer**: TBD  
**Release Date**: November 11, 2024  
**License**: Open Source (TBD)

**Intended Use**:  
This model is designed as an experimental, educational tool to assist federal employees in navigating and comparing health plan options during the Federal Benefits Open Season, from November 11 to December 9, 2024. It helps users make informed decisions by providing plan information and comparisons based on user preferences. The tool is also intended as a learning resource for individuals interested in developing similar generative AI applications.

**Primary Users**:  
- Federal employees seeking guidance on health plan selection.
- Individuals interested in understanding and building GPT-based decision support tools.

**Out-of-Scope Use Cases**:  
This model should not be used for making definitive health or financial recommendations, storing sensitive personal data, or as a substitute for official resources and professional guidance.

## **Model Details**

**Training Data**:  
The model was developed using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that accesses a curated corpus of federal health plan documents specific to the 2025 benefit season. Data sources include official OPM resources, plan brochures, and other publicly available documents relevant to federal employee health plans.

**Data Limitations**:  
The authoritative corpus covers selected plans and may not address all geographic locations or specific situations. This model is valid for Open Season 2024 (November 11 - December 9) and may not include the latest updates outside of this period.

**Data Privacy**:  
The model does not collect or store personal data and instructs users to avoid entering private or sensitive information.

**Evaluation**:  
- **Accuracy**: Evaluated on common federal health plan comparisons. Accuracy may vary depending on the user's specific needs and geographic location.
- **Bias**: Minimal expected; the corpus includes official federal resources, though limitations in geographic or plan-specific coverage may affect comprehensiveness.

**Model Performance**:  
Performance metrics on sample tasks:  
- **Plan Comparison Accuracy**: TBD  
- **Terminology Explanation Accuracy**: TBD  
- **Multilingual Support (English and Spanish)**: TBD

## **Intended Use Context**

The tool is valid for the 2025 benefit season and is only applicable during Open Season (November 11 to December 9, 2024). Users should verify all information with official sources. The tool is limited to general information and decision support, and it may not address unique individual or geographic considerations.

## **Limitations**

**Known Limitations**:  
- **Scope of Coverage**: Limited to certain federal health plans; may not include all options or geographies.
- **Outdated Information**: Only updated through the 2025 benefit season, valid for Open Season 2024.
- **AI Limitations**: May generate errors or incomplete information. Users are advised to verify details with official resources.

**Ethical Considerations**:  
This model is experimental and should not be used as an official resource or a substitute for professional advice. It is designed solely for educational purposes and demonstrates how AI can assist with general decision support.

**Potential Risks**:  
- Misinterpretation of plan information if used as a definitive guide.
- Potential for user confusion without verification from official sources.
- Lack of privacy guarantees for sensitive data inputs.

## **Fairness and Mitigations**

**Bias Mitigation**:  
The model leverages a balanced, authoritative corpus sourced from official federal resources. To mitigate any unintentional bias, users are consistently advised to verify details with OPM and other official sources.

**Accessibility**:  
- **Language Support**: Available in both English and Spanish.
- **Commands**: Supports both command-based and conversational interaction to facilitate diverse user needs.
